## BC-UR

There is no JavaScript library on NPM that suitably encodes/decodes
BC-UR data. JavaScript code to do the same does exist, but embedded
with projects such as Specter Desktop or Cobo Vault.

This code is copied from Cobo Vault's implementation: https://github.com/CoboVault/cobo-vault-blockchain-base/tree/master/packages
